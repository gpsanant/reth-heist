   *   0 -> Don't open any debt, just revert if funds can't be transferred from the receiver
   *   1 -> Open debt at stable rate for the value of the amount flash-borrowed to the `onBehalfOf` address
   *   2 -> Open debt at variable rate for the value of the amount flash-borrowed to the `onBehalfOf` address
   * @param onBehalfOf The address  that will receive the debt in the case of using on `modes` 1 or 2
   * @param params Variadic packed params to pass to the receiver as extra information
   * @param referralCode Code used to register the integrator originating the operation, for potential rewards.
   *   0 if the action is executed directly by the user, without any middle-man
